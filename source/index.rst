==================================================
Iowa Food-Energy-Water system (IFEWs)
==================================================

The model for the Iowa Food-Energy-Water system (IFEWs) is a **Python-based model that encodes the interdependencies and evolution of Food-Energy-Water (FEW) resources using NASAâ€™s OpenMDAO framework**. This model uses a theory of multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) with a focus on balancing the independent food, water, and energy disciplines. Its primary objective is to develop an interface that aids in decision-making for the long-term sustainability and resilience of Iowa's ecosystem while meeting the state's socioeconomic needs and considering the environmental impact of nitrogen export.
