Welcome to the project of Iowa Food-Energy-Water Systems (IFEWs). We are a research team at Iowa State University, an institution heavily engaged in agricultural research and outreach, and our team brings expertise from both agriculture as well as other disciplines in which decision support for large-scale complex engineered systems has been a critical research area. **This project is funded by the U. S. National Science Foundation under grant no. 1739551.** Check the :ref:`IFEWsmodel_tutorial` section for more details.
