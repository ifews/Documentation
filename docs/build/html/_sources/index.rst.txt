==================================================
Iowa Food-Energy-Water system (IFEWs)
==================================================

The model for the Iowa Food-Energy-Water system (IFEWs) is a **Python-based model that encodes the interdependencies and evolution of Food-Energy-Water (FEW) resources using NASAâ€™s OpenMDAO framework**. This model uses a theory of multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) with a focus on balancing the independent food, water, and energy disciplines. Its primary objective is to develop an interface that aids in decision-making for the long-term sustainability and resilience of Iowa's ecosystem while meeting the state's socioeconomic needs and considering the environmental impact of nitrogen export.

Figure 1 provides a visual representation of the systems under consideration and their interdependencies, as indicated by the directional arrows.

The analysis of the system, employing MDAO, can be comprehensively visualized in eXtended Design Structure Matrix (XDSM) as shown in figure 2.
