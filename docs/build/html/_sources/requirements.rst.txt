============

-IFEWs model depends external packages to do multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO). The following packages are required to download: 
    • Numpy
    • Pandas
    • Openmdao
    • Sklearn

-Installation instructions:
You can simply download the requirements by using pip from yout python environment (we recommend Anaconda)::

	pip install numpy

	pip install 'openmdao[all]'

	pip install scikit-learn
	
**Note**
To ensure the installation of optional dependencies, use the [all] suffix with the install command. However, it is not necessary for a basic installation.


**Note**
Numpy will be automatically installed along with scikit-learn because numpy is one of the dependencies.
